<ul><li><strong>Through the guidance of the music pillar, the D.S.O had invented a new method of  surveillance. Through the use of Void Transmission technology, people across the  world could view the events of the National Exam in real time. From open fields to the  smalles t compartments hidden beneath a building. A basic guide to the technology:</strong> </li><li><strong>Spec Camera:</strong> Collects visual feed from several miles away.</li><li><strong>D.S.O Relay:</strong> Receives and transmits the collected data.</li><li><strong>D.S.O.I (Intelligence):</strong> Converts this information into visual data, with the help of  several supercomputers. Extended Method of transmission:   The Spec Camera : Large black boxes that emit a web of sensory particles across their  designated area. Each box is encased in a thin layer of polycarbonate glass, with each  unit containing a core of advanced computational hardware, typically equipped with  the latest generation DU -32 decoding chips. Behind these processors lies a secured  compartment that houses semi -unstable VX crystals that have  been meticulously  tuned for high -precision sensory data.   D.S.O Relays : There are several transmission towers and satellites owned by the  D.S.O. These are partially used to receive and transmit any information sent by a Spec  Camera. Each relay is specifically adapted to stabilise the raw and unstable format of  VX energy.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>D.S.O.I (Intelligence):</strong> The Intelligence sector of the D.S.O receives and converts these  transmissions to comprehensible information. This is possible due to the technological  milestone of the supercomputer, capable of translating stabilised and compressed  sensory data received v ia the relays across the globe. Extra facts:</li><li>The first -generation spec cameras are capable of firing sensory particles across  a 5-mile radius and can be fine -tuned to specific locations.</li><li>Due to their sub -atomic size and complex structure, VX particles allow data to  be densely encoded and transmitted efficiently via electromagnetic signals.</li><li>The transmitted information may appear slightly simple at first glance, but it  contains an incredibly dense collection of data that a supercomputer can  convert into a visual feed.</li></ul></main></body></html>
