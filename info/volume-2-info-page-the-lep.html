<h1>(Volume 2) Info page: The L.E.P</h1>
<p>Founded by the World Government two centuries after the Last War, the Law  Enforcement Police was created as a global force tasked with upholding the law and  ensuring public safety worldwide.  Initially, each Sector had its own politics and police force. However, over time, tensions  rose, and the outbreak of an international war was imminent. This led to a historical  event known as ‘The Hypocrits’, where every political group was disbanded and n ew  factions were formed with the vision of the World Government.</p>
