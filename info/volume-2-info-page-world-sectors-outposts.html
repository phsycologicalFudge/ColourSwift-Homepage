<h1>(Volume 2) Info Page: World Sectors &amp;</h1>
<p>Outposts  Sectors  During the initial reconstruction of the Gaia, formally known as Earth before the war,  the World Government assigned the remaining countries a numerical identifier for  simple communication. Examples: • Sector 9 = Japan • Sector 1 = United Kingdom • Sector 5 = United States • Sector 8 = China Cardinal Directions  To identify individual cities within a sector, a directional tag was added: • A = North • B = East • C = South • D = West  This creates combined identifiers: • Sector 1C = United Kingdom, South ( London ) • Sector 9B = Japan, east ( New Tokyo ) Outposts  Each directional tag is further subdivided into smaller units called outposts.  For example, the city of Blackreach is assigned the numerical value 7, with the  directional tag A (North). Following this logic: • Outpost 7A, Sector 9B is located in East Japan, north of New Tokyo.</p></main></body></html>
