<div class="codex-body">
<p>
    Founded in the fifth century A.W. (After War), the Demonic Surveillance Organization, or <strong>D.S.O</strong>, was established to combat the rising tide of night-born demonic entities. What began as a desperate defense initiative evolved into humanity’s strongest bulwark—the iron wall between extinction and survival. Today, it stands not just as a military power, but as a symbol of discipline, fear, and salvation.

<h3 class="">❖ D.S.O Rank Structure ❖</h3>
<hr/>
<p><strong class="">Ranks are divided into two primary operational classes:</strong> Guard Ranks and Agent Ranks, with the rarest title—<strong class="">Holy Pillar</strong>—standing above all.</p>
<h4><u>Guard Ranks (Frontline Initiation and Defense Units)</u></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>F-Rank</strong> – Trainees undergoing foundational combat and <span>Void</span> exposure protocols.</li>
<li><strong>E-Rank</strong> – Exam-ready candidates marked for field evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>D-Rank</strong> – Fully enlisted Common Ground Soldiers (C.G.S.); assigned basic field duties.</li>
<li><strong>C-Rank</strong> – Senior C.G.S.; experienced operatives specializing in support, reconnaissance, or logistics.</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>Agent Ranks (Elite Operatives and High-Level Combat Units)</u></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>B-Rank</strong> – Certified field agents with stable <span>Void</span> reserves; capable of limited demon suppression missions.</li>
<li><strong>A-Rank</strong> – High-level tacticians and combatants; often deployed solo to decimate enemy strongholds.</li>
<li><strong>S-Rank</strong> – The apex of standard ranks. Their <span>Void</span> resonance and power output are often compared to natural disasters.</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>Holy Pillar (Transcendent Authority)</u></h4>
<p>
    More than a title—it is a legacy carved in blood, silence, and unshakable will.
  </p>
<p>Holy Pillars are not merely warriors. They are the embodiment of the D.S.O.’s soul. </p>
<p>
    They are said to carry within them the truths of existence:
  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Life.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Death.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Joy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pain.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Their very presence is said to bend the atmosphere.<br/>
    Even the heavens lean beneath a Pillar’s will.
