<h1>Codex Fragment: The Emphetripia Heart</h1>
<p>After the final war against the Voidborn, the world changed.</p>
<p>The Emphetripia Gland—an unnatural second heart—grew beneath the first.</p>
<p>It did not beat. It stored. Void. A reservoir of unshaped power.</p>
<p>The larger the gland, the greater the potential. It became the foundation of humanity's Void Walking.</p>
<p>The Tenshiro were said to be blessed. Born with greater hearts. Greater futures. Or so the world believed.</p>
