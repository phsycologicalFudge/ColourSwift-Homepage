  <p>
    <strong>Elemental Movement Arts</strong> are not magic spells.
  </p>
  <p>
    They are kinetic combat systems — rooted in VX-neuromuscular flow, refined by breath, and shaped through repetition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only a small number of Void Walkers possess the neural alignment required to activate even the basic sequences of each art.
  </p>
  <p>
    As such, they are classified as non-essential augmentations and are not a requirement for standard D.S.O. field operations.
  </p>
  <p><em>Note:</em> Improper execution of any Art may result in severe muscle tissue atrophy (degradation).</p>

    <li>Void Walkers channel nerve current through VX-pathways, enabling sharp bursts of speed and violent directional shifts.</li>
