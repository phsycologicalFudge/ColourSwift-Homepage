    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated December 30, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Notice for Colourswift Limited (“we,” “us,” or “our”) explains how we collect, use,
      and protect your personal information when you use our services (“Services”), including our website, mobile
      applications, and cloud services.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please discontinue use of our Services. If you have questions,
      contact us at <a href="mailto:support@colourswift.com">support@colourswift.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>1.1 Disclaimer for ColourSwift Security</h2>
    <p>
      ColourSwift Security provides antivirus protection through a combination of on-device scanning
      and cloud-assisted threat intelligence.
      All file analysis and scanning logic execute locally on device.
      No file contents, metadata, or scan results are uploaded to or stored on
      ColourSwift servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When enabled, realtime protection uses cloud-based threat intelligence to improve detection accuracy.
      This process involves submitting cryptographic file hashes for threat lookup purposes only.
      Hash lookups do not include file contents and are not used for profiling, analytics, or tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manual scans may be performed without using cloud-based threat intelligence.
      When cloud lookups are disabled for manual scanning, all detection is performed entirely on-device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app may request permissions such as storage access or notification access
      solely to enable local scanning and realtime protection.
      These permissions are never used for analytics, marketing, profiling, or advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      This disclaimer applies specifically to ColourSwift Security.
      Other ColourSwift Limited services follow the broader privacy principles outlined in this policy.
    </p>
