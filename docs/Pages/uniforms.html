<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classification:</strong> Fieldwear Regulation</p>
<p><strong>Clearance:</strong> Class D</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Initiates</strong> (F to C-Rank)</p>
<p>
    Trainees are issued a plain black military set—pressed jacket and slacks, minimalist in design, resembling formalwear.
  </p>
<p>
    Each uniform is embedded with a low-grade <strong>Sigil of Protection</strong>, offering baseline Void resistance and environmental shielding.
  </p>
<p><strong>Agents</strong> (B to A-Rank)</p>
<p>
    Field-ready personnel are granted a revised set: black military attire with a <strong>short leather coat</strong>, worn draped over the shoulders in cloak-like fashion.
  </p>
<p>
    This design prioritizes mobility and symbolic presence.
  </p>
<p><strong>Elite Operatives</strong> (S-Rank and above)</p>
<p>
    Those who stand at the apex of the agency receive the Helm <strong>of Authority</strong>—a high-ranking insignia signifying command status and operational sovereignty.
  </p>
<p>
    It is the <strong>second-highest honor</strong> bestowed within the D.S.O.
