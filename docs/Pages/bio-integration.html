  <h3><strong>Void Particle Classification: V₁</strong></h3>

  <p>
    Known officially as <strong>V₁ Particles</strong>, these subatomic fragments are the foundational carriers of Void resonance in biological and synthetic forms. Unlike any element on the standard periodic table, V₁s behave as quantum-bonding anomalies, reacting with traditional matter on a molecular level. They do not exist naturally on Earth—only in regions saturated with Void exposure.
  </p>
  <p>
    When stabilized, V₁s bind to existing atoms—most commonly <strong>carbon, silicon, and calcium</strong>—creating advanced <strong>Voidborne Compounds</strong>. These fusions drastically enhance the tensile strength, energy retention, and elemental resistance of the host material.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Key Compounds</strong></h3>

  <p><strong>1. VX-Ceramite (V₁ + reinforced carbon lattice)</strong></p>
  <p>
    Used in the armour plating of D.S.O. agent uniforms, VX-Ceramite is flexible, energy-resistant, and capable of <strong>reactive Void deflection</strong>. It retains molecular cohesion even under sustained Void contact.
  </p>

  <p><strong>2. VX-Myosin (V₁ + organic myosin proteins)</strong></p>
  <p>
    Formed naturally in Void-exposed operatives, this compound strengthens <strong>muscle fibre</strong>, enhances <strong>neural conductivity</strong>, and increases <strong>reflex compression tolerance</strong>. While extremely effective, VX-Myosin has shown signs of <strong>psychogenic interference</strong> under prolonged use.
  </p>

  <p><strong>3. Aetherite (V₁ raw mineral form)</strong></p>
  <p>
    A naturally occurring crystalline matrix found at Void exposure sites. Aetherite is unstable, and used primarily in controlled refinement to extract trace V₁ for artificial infusion.
  </p>

  <h3><strong>Biological Integration</strong></h3>

  <p>
    In certain individuals, especially those with an <strong>Emphetripia Heart</strong>, V₁ particles embed themselves in <strong>skeletal muscle, nerve clusters, and even bone marrow</strong>, becoming part of the subject’s bio-architecture. This integration is what allows select agents to survive high-grade Void encounters, though side effects vary—ranging from cellular decay to full Void corruption in extreme cases.
