<blockquote>
<p><em>“A wall is raised not to conquer, but to cradle.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In the centuries following the First Demonic Sundering, when the Void split the skies and the world—silent, survivors fled across the shattered continents. Among them was a healer named Catherine of the Bleeding Cloth, who walked barefoot for forty nights, binding the wounds of strangers with her own garments.
  </p>
<p>
    Where her blood last fell, a sanctuary rose—a haven untouched by demonic presence.
  </p>
<p>
    Over time, the Holy Wall of St. Catherine was raised in her name. Unlike the towering fortresses of the northern cities, it was not built with the intent to fight, but to <em>shelter</em>. White stones etched with sigils of binding and mercy lined its core. Mothers, widows, and broken soldiers found rest inside its embrace. It was said that even demons would not cross the wall unless invited.
  </p>
<p>
    But the wall did not stand alone.
  </p>
<p>
    Beyond its heart, at each cardinal point, stood four gates—armored, consecrated, and deadly. The largest and oldest of them faces the northern frontier.
  </p>
<p>
    It is called <strong>The Last Gate of Michael.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Named for the Archangel who once cast down the Void Serpent in forgotten ages, the Gate of Michael is a place of <strong>final judgment</strong>. Demons who cross it do not return unchanged. The gate’s guardians are not trained for defense—they are trained for <em>annihilation</em>.
