    The <strong>Demonic Surveillance Organization (D.S.O.)</strong> requires all potential agents to undergo a three-stage qualification process designed to filter, forge, and finalize the warriors of humanity’s last line of defense.
  </p>

    Those who pass the exam are officially recognized as <strong>Voidguards</strong> or <strong>D.S.O. Agents</strong>, and are granted a rank reflective of their performance—ranging from D to S.
